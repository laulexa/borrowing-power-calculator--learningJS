# borrowing-power-calculator--learningJS
I am going to make a borrowing power calculator. To calculate the borrowing power I have to ask the user about his income and debts and apply the following formula:

This is the formula that many banks in Colombia use to calculate the borrowing power:

borrowing power = (Monthly income â€“monthly debts) x 0,35.

The 0.35 is due to the fact that today, it is considered that debts should not exceed 35% of a person's monthly net income. If the calculation result is close to zero, it is not convenient to get a loan.
